    <h2><span>about me</span></h2>

    <p>Hiya! 👋</p>
    <p>My name's Josh, I'm a 23 year old web developer from Manchester, UK 🐝</p>
    <p>I've been programming for over 10 years, the last 5 of those working full time as a web developer.</p>
    <p>I've got tons of experience in HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript (inc. jQuery, Vue and Node), and I'm always up for a new challenge!</p>
    <p>
      Outside of that you can usually find me playing video games,
      <a href="https://www.songkick.com/users/jo.sh.ee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listening to music</a>
      or travelling abroad.
    </p>
